# Preparing the Project
I started off by creating the index.html file and also installed SCSS into the project.

I used SCSS/SASS for this project because it will allow me to write and manage my CSS quickly and efficiently.

I also created the JavsScript folder and file.

# HTML
The grid for the calender is genered using JavaScript, this means it will be easier for me to manage as I will not need to create individual cells manually.

I have formatted the HTML into separate sections in order to make it clean and readable.

The month and dates are static, however you are able to change the week and create multiple events using the next and previous buttons.

# JavaScript
This project does not use any frameworks or libraries. All code was written in vanilla JS.

The grid used is generated using the for loop, which appends the cells to the container. This allows me to easily manage the HTML for the cells without creating the static HTML myself.

Each cell is linked to a event listener, this allows the user to create an event, update an event and delete an event if required.

Prompts and confirmation dialogs are used in order to receive and process user inputs.

Tabs were created in order to allow the user to switch weeks.

# SASS/CSS
SASS is used in this project as it allows for more legible code when working within nested elements.

Media queries were used in order to adjust the mobile layout.

# Libraries Used

- SASS
